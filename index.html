            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In 2007, we built and established Hunar Ghar School. We work closely with our local operational partner Rajasthan Bal Kalyan Samiti (RBKS) to provide an inclusive and holistic education for over 400 children aged between four and fourteen
                through Hunar Ghar. Most of these children are the first in their families to attend school. Our approach at Hunar Ghar ensures that all students are supported to learn and develop a range of academic and life skills which will enable
                them to make choices about their futures. We believe that good health and good learning go hand in hand. Our team has been trained to keep an eye on students’ health. We monitor their growth and development, ensure they are up to date
                with all their vaccines and make sure each student has an annual health check by a paediatrician. An annual eye camp and an annual dental camp also take place at the school. There are high levels of malnutrition in Bakhel. To tackle this,
                all students receive two nutritious meals a day, breakfast and lunch.</p>
